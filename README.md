Base classes and tools providing a full CRUD interface. Contains model and controller generators.

## TODO

* Write an example schema for PostgreSQL that contains:
    * tables with same name in different schemas
    * composite pk keys
    * composite fk keys
    * fk keys pointing to unique, but not pk columns
    * all relations: belongs to, has one/has many, many many
* Check if relations are sorted
* Support special columns: last edited/created, last editor/author, soft delete, display order
* Write down what advanced rules are generated
